 * treated as a different listener. The same family reasoning governs the

/**
 * A dashboard token minted against the gateway that owns the dialed listener.
 *
 * The credential sent is the one that gateway published for its own listener,
 * identified by the address AND the port that were dialed. Neither the home-wide
 * `.local_secret` nor a port-keyed entry is a second place to look. The shared
 * file holds one slot per data home on a last-writer-wins basis, and a port-keyed
 * entry names every listener sharing that port number, so either can hold a
 * credential belonging to a gateway this call never reached. Sending that to
 * whoever answers here would surrender a credential which authenticates
 * elsewhere. An entry keyed by the dialed listener cannot escalate, because the
 * only listener it authenticates against is the one it was just sent to.
 *
 * An absent entry therefore denies rather than widens. A port no local gateway
 * bound on this address, an `ssh -L` forward's local end among them, whether or
 * not a v6-bound gateway holds the same port number, has no credential to read,
 * so the caller falls through to the remote-token path and then to the token
 * prompt.
 *
 * A REFUSED entry is not the end of the walk either. `clear_marker` runs only on
 * a graceful shutdown, so a crashed gateway leaves its entry behind, and a stale
 * exact-address entry sitting beside the live wildcard one would otherwise spend
 * the single attempt and report no token while a working credential was never
 * tried. Continuing costs nothing that matters: a dead generation's secret
 * authenticates against no listener at all, and every candidate names a listener
 * on the address being dialed, so the walk never reaches a party this call did
 * not reach.
