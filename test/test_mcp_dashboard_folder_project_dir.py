"""``project_dir`` on the folder tools, driven through the REAL folder routes.

``test_mcp_dashboard_folders.py`` patches the HTTP helpers and pins the tool's
call shape. This module closes the other half of the tool's claim — that the
tool surfaces the endpoint's validation rather than a copy of it — by wiring
``mcp_dashboard``'s ``_get`` / ``_post`` / ``_patch`` to a live aiohttp test
server running ``chat_folders``' own handlers over a real ``DashboardState``,
then reading the store the routes wrote. The slot-create route is included so
the inheritance the feature exists for is observed end to end: a folder the
tool bound is one a session created inside it inherits from.

The tool is synchronous (it is a stdio MCP server), so it runs on a worker
thread while the bridge hands each request back to the test's event loop with
``run_coroutine_threadsafe`` — the same request/response contract
``mcp_core._send`` presents (a 2xx body verbatim; a 4xx collapsed to
``{"error", "code"}``).
