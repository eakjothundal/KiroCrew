"""Ownership on the chat-folder tree-shaping endpoints.

A folder created by an app carries it in ``owner_app``; an absent key reads as
the person's, which is what makes this a field addition rather than a migration.
An app may create at the top level or inside a folder it owns, and may rename,
reparent or delete only what it owns. The person is never confined.

The scope is derived from the authenticated calling session, never the body: the
managed MCP set authenticates with the internal secret, which carries no app
claim, so an app agent's tool call arrives with ``request["app"]`` empty.
